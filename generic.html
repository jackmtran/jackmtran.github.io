									<h1><a href="https://x-clone-wzd4.onrender.com/">X</a></h1>
									<p>This web application, built with a robust tech stack including React.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Tailwind, provides a seamless and engaging user experience. Leveraging the power of React.js, the application features a dynamic and responsive interface, allowing users to interact with content in real-time. The use of React Query enhances data fetching and caching, ensuring efficient performance and minimizing load times while keeping the user interface smooth and responsive.

										On the backend, Node.js and Express form a strong foundation, enabling the application to handle multiple concurrent connections with ease. This ensures a fast and scalable server environment capable of processing user requests, managing authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and facilitating smooth communication with the MongoDB database. Users can enjoy a rich set of features, including creating, deleting, and liking posts, as well as commenting on content.
										
										The application also offers suggested profiles to follow, enriching the social aspect of user interaction. Account management is straightforward, with options for users to edit their profile information and images, supported by image uploads via Cloudinary. Additionally, the application sends timely notifications to keep users engaged and informed about activities on their posts.
